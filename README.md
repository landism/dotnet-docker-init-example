Welcome to the Docker Init CLI!

This utility will walk you through creating the following files with sensible defaults for your project:

âœ” Your Docker files are ready!

Take a moment to review them and tailor them to your application.

When you're ready, start your application by running: docker compose up --build

Your application will be available at http://localhost:8080

Consult README.Docker.md for more information about using the generated files.
